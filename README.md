# Ilana-Mahmea's Personal Homepage

This is a simple HTTP/CSS/JS page built with Bootstrap. It's a typical personal website, providing some information about my career path, experience, skills, projects and hobbies.

## Project Overview

I, [Ilana-Mahmea Siegel](https://github.com/m-siegel/), created this for [Northeastern University CS5610 Web Development](https://johnguerra.co/classes/webDevelopment_fall_2022/).

My objectives were
- To become familiar with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript through hands-on practice and experimentation, and
- To create a personal website that I can link to for both personal and professional use.

I used the following technologies:
- Figma – for planning and page mock-ups.
- HTML – for site and page structure.
- CSS – for page styling (primarily color choice).
- Bootstrap – for page styling (responsive grid, tabs, carousel, cards, etc.).
- JavaScript – for the typing effect on the landing page.

## Running

This page is mostly static, with a little JavaScript.
You can view and interact with it at [m-siegel.github.io](https://m-siegel.github.io).
To run it on your computer, clone this repo, navigate to it in the command line, then launch a web server via % http-server, % python http.server(), or % reload -b
